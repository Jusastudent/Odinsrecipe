                <h2>Equipment / Tips</h2>
                  <li> 6cm x 6cm and 2.5cm deep for each cup. Yours might be deeper than mine. If so, just don’t fill it too the top and fill it to around 2cm deep to mimic the pan I have.</li>
                  <li>Butter your tin well if you aren’t lining it with a strip of baking paper like in my video</li>
                  <li>Line the cups of your pan with a strip of baking paper as it ensures that it will come out in one piece when you go to remove it as the brownies are quite soft</li>
                  <li>If you aren’t lining it, you’ll need to let them cool for longer in the tin until they are firm enough for you to remove them.</li>
                  <li> The espresso powder brings out the flavour of the cocoa in the brownie. You can use instant black coffee powder in a pinch. Those instant coffee granules/powder that you can get in the supermarket will work.</li>
                  <li>I use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the sugar butter mixture for the fudgey brownie. But if you don’t have one, a rough indication is that after adding the sugar when the butter has almost melted and whilst stirring on low heat, your sugar mixture would be ready to go within 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                  <li>As the brownies cool after they have been baked (especially if it’s cold where you are) they firm up and become more dense. So if you want it soft again, just heat it up in 5 seconds blasts in the microwave until warm in the middle or in the oven at 180C for 4 mins or so.</li>
                  <li>Don’t get too excited with placing too much filling into your brownie. You want to ensure you can still cover your filling with batter and keep the amount of batter in your tin to around 3/4 full or it might overflow.</li>
                  <li>For the cakey brownies, if you wish to have an extra moist brownie, you can use 10g of neutral oil like canola in replacement of the water</li>
              </ul>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>

        <li>Preheat over to 180C</li>
        <li>Brush some softened butter and line each cup of your baking pan with a strip of parchment paper. I am using a brownie pan that is square but you can use a cupcake pan.</li>
        <li>In a pot, melt your butter and chocolate over low heat constantly stirring to ensure your chocolate doesn’t burn.</li>
      <li>When all the butter has almost melted, add the sugar and salt and heat on low heat whilst stirring until it is around 60-63C. If you do not have a thermometer, your mixture should be ready in 30seconds – 1 minute.</li>
<p>(Important: You are not looking for fully melted sugar, it should still feel grainy. If in doubt, take it off the heat a little earlier)</p>
<li>Remove your pot from the stove and add the fridge cold egg and stir until combined and well mixed and homogenous. You don’t need to wait for your mixture to cool before adding the egg.</li>
<p>Important: Your batter should be homogenous at this step. It might take 1-2 mins of mixing but the sugar, butter and egg should bind together, you shouldn’t see a layer of oil. If you do, that means you will need to mix it for longer until it’s well combined.</p>
<li>Add cocoa powders, espresso powder and vanilla and stir until combined into a smooth mixture.</li>
<li>It shouldn’t feel like it’s separating if you have mixed it well enough. It might take you 1-2 mins of mixing with a spatula to get it well combined. </li>
<li>Add the flour and mix it in until just combined.</li>
<li>For the Sea Salt Brownies, spoon batter into each cup until it is filled 3/4 of the way to the top and topped with flaked sea salt.</li>
<li>For the Nutella filled brownies, place a layer of batter into your tin to cover the base, make a small well, and add 1tsp (heaped teaspoon at most) of Nutella filling and gently add batter on the top and spread it to ensure your brownie is covered. Top with chopped hazelnuts. You want to ensure each cup is only filled to 3/4 of the cup.</li>
<li>Bake at 180C for 13-14 minutes.  </li>
<li>When the brownies are ready, a toothpick down the middle should come out with very moist crumbs sticking to it.</li>
<li>If in doubt, it is best to under bake them than to over bake.</li>
<li>Let cool in the tin for 5 minutes before removing and cooling on the rack.</li>
<li>Enjoy slightly warm or room temp. For a denser brownie, you can enjoy them cold from the fridge.</li>
