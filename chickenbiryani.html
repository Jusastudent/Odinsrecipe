         <h2>Preperation</h2>
         <h3>Marinade</h3>
         <li>Chop 1/2 of the onion into chunks and add it to a food processor or blender with the garlic, ginger, cloves, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, cumin, poppy seeds, salt, and lemon juice. Blend until it is a smooth paste. Add the paste to a large bowl and mix together with the yogurt and chicken pieces.</li>
         <li>Heat the oil over medium heat in a cast-iron skillet or dutch oven. Slice the other onions into very thin rings. Add the bay leaves and black cardamom to the oil and fry for 15 seconds. Put in the onions and fry, while stirring, for about 10 minutes until brown and crisp (be careful not to burn them). Remove with a slotted spoon. Reserve the oil, black cardamom, and bay leaves for garnish later on. Mix two-thirds of the fried onions with the marinade paste and drain the remaining on a paper towel for garnishing.</li>
         <li>Remove skin from the chicken pieces and cut them into pieces. Pierce the chicken or make slashes in them and mix into the marinade paste. Cover and let refrigerate for at least two hours.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <li>Pour the chicken and marinade into a cast-iron skillet. Turn the heat to medium and bring to a boil, then cover and place on low heat to simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken pieces and place in a casserole dish. Boil down the marinade until reduced by half then remove from the heat. Preheat oven to 300 F.</li>
        <li>Soak the saffron in hot but not boiling milk. </li>
        <li>Bring water and salt to a boil in a large pot and add the rice. After it comes to a boil again, set a timer for 5 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander and place it on top of the chicken in the casserole dish. Pour the saffron milk over the rice in orange lines. Spoon the onion-flavored oil from the pan along with the cardamom and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place the lid over top to seal the dish. Bake for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Spoon the biryani onto a plate and sprinkle with fried onions and other garnishes of your choice.</li>
