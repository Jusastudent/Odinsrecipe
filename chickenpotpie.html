         <h2>Preperation</h2>
         <li>Generously season chicken on all sides with B-Man’s Dry Brine Seasoning (recipe above) then refrigerate to cure for 12-24 hours. Slow roast at 285F/140C for 2.5-3hours. Allow chicken to rest for 20-30min. </li>
         <h3>Chicken Stock</h3>
        <li>Lay chicken backs & feet on sheet tray. Roast at 450C/230F for 25-30min. Add chicken backs, feet, & pan drippings to a slow cooker with water and slowcook for 8 hrs. Strain & refrigerate until ready for use. </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <li>Preheat large heavy-bottomed pot over med high. Add butter then veggies, garlic, large pinch of salt & stir to combine. Sweat for 5-6min. Add potatoes & continue to cook for 3 mins or so. Add flour & stir to coat veg. Continue stirring frequently for 2-3 minutes or until raw edge of flour is cooked off. Add sherry &cook for about a minute then add stock. Stir & reduce heat to med-low. Bring to a simmer, cover & cook 15-20min or until potatoes are tender. Once tender, add peas & chicken. When peas & chicken are heated through, remove from heat & taste for seasoning. I add salt & plenty of pepper. </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken pieces and place in a casserole dish. Boil down the marinade until reduced by half then remove from the heat. Preheat oven to 300 F.</li>
        <li>Soak the saffron in hot but not boiling milk. </li>
        <li>Bring water and salt to a boil in a large pot and add the rice. After it comes to a boil again, set a timer for 5 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander and place it on top of the chicken in the casserole dish. Pour the saffron milk over the rice in orange lines. Spoon the onion-flavored oil from the pan along with the cardamom and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place the lid over top to seal the dish. Bake for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Spoon the biryani onto a plate and sprinkle with fried onions and other garnishes of your choice.</li>
      </ol>
<ol>
  <h3>Pie Crust</h3>
  <li>Add flour, salt, & butter (sliced) to a food processor. Process for 15 secs or until pebbly. Add sour cream & egg. Process just until dough becomes yellow & starts to look like dough. Flip out onto work surface and gently combine and press into a rectangle. Wrap & refrigerate for 20min. </li>
  <li>Slice off a 125g piece of dough, roll into a ball. Flour dough then roll out until it’s approx a ⅛” or 3mm thick round. Place ramekin the dough round and trace around the outside, leaving a couple of cm buffer around the outside.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <h3>Build & Bake</h3>
<li>Fill each ramekin most of the way full. Coat rim and sides of rim with egg wash. </li>
<li>Top with pie crust round & pinch to adhere to ramekin. Cut slits in top of dough. Brush dough with egg wash.</li>
<li>Place ramekins on a sheet tray and bake in preheated 405F/205C oven for 25 minutes. Pies are finished when crust is cooked and golden brown. Allow to cool slightly  before eating.</li>
