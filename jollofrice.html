         <h2>Preperation</h2>
      <li>To prepare the spice mix, choose a measuring spoon or regular spoon to represent ‘1 part’ by volume. Add all the spices to a container and mix them.</li>
         <li>In a blender, add a half can of peeled tomatoes, 1/4 of a white onion, the red bell peppers, habanero, and a sprinkle of salt. Blend until completely smooth.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <li>Set a pan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Very thinly slice the red onion and then toss it in the pan. Saute for about 5 minutes until softened and starting to brown, but they still have a bite to them.</li>
        <li>In the onion pan, add the bay leaves, jollof spice mix, curry powder, and cayenne powder, if using. Toast for 30 seconds before pouring in the sauce from the blender. Bring the liquid to a simmer, then turn the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 15 minutes during which it will reduce and thicken.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the basmati rice 3 to 4 times in a strainer to remove the starches and preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Once the Jollof sauce is done reducing, place a pan or pot that has an oven-safe lid over medium heat and add more vegetable oil just to cover the pan. Once hot, toss in the washed rice and toast for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the reduced Jollof sauce to the pan with the rice and stir together before stirring in the chicken stock into the pan as well. Bring the liquid to a simmer then cover the pan with an oven-safe lid (aluminum foil works well too). Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pot to the preheated 350 F oven. Set a timer for 30 minutes during which the rice should become tender. (Note: Prepare the chicken thighs while this in the oven)</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes. Fluff the rice and then stir in the fresh red onions, if using. Serve with the protein of your choice, such as the chicken thighs below, garnish with cilantro.</li>
      </ol>
<ol>
  <h3>Chicken Thighs</h3>
  <li>Salt both sides of the chicken thighs.</li>
  <li>Set a cast-iron pan over medium heat and add the chicken thighs, skin side down, to the cold pan which will begin to render the chicken fat. Let cook until the skin has browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once the fat has been rendered, flip the chicken thigh over and lower the heat. Add the butter sprig of fresh thyme, two cloves of garlic, and sprinkle the Jollof Spice mix. Baste the fat and spices over the top of the chicken thigh.</li>
  <li>Place the entire pan into the oven with the cooking rice and cook until the internal temp reaches to 170 F; if you time it right, you can have both the rice and chicken ready at the same time.</li>
  <li>Serve the chicken on a bed of jollof rice and garnish with cilantro and pickled onions.</li>
