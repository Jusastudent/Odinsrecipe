        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          *These cookies will need to bake at 160°C/320°F and bake for 12 minutes. However, as making these cookies is very time consuming (i.e. measuring the dough, rolling and then wrapping them individually), preheat your oven when you’re nearly done with making all your cookies, as opposed to the very start to save on gas and energy.
        </p>
        <li>Melt 150g chocolate and 40g unsalted butter in microwave until just beginning to melt, 30-45 seconds. Stir until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, brown sugar and salt together, and whisk until the mixture is smooth and bubbly. Add in your chocolate mixture and vanilla extract and stir well – the mixture should fall in ribbons back into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Sift the baking powder, baking soda and flour together over the chocolate mixture and stir until smooth and combined. Refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk the butter, sugar and salt together until light and fluffy. Add in the egg and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Sift cake flour over the mixture and stir until well combined. Flatten the dough into a fat disc and wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Cut your cream-coloured dough into even sections, and then into equal cubes (approx. 7g each). Roll each portion into a ball before flattening against the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Divide the Nutella mixture into 10g each and roll into a ball. Wrap the cream dough around Nutella ball, pinching and smoothing to entirely cover the Nutella ball. Roll the ball around the palms of your hands, before gently flattening the ball on baking paper.</li>
        <li>Oven should be set at 160°C/320°F. Bake the cookies for 12 minutes. Transfer the cookies onto a wire rack to cool before enjoying!</li>
